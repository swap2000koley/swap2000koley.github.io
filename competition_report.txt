Our proposed system is  build on a unified encoder-decoder based instance segmentation framework with a Swin Transformer backbone. The method adapts a contrastive training with a mixed query selection for anchor initialization in the decoder. Later on, it performs a dot product between the obtained query embeddings and the pixel embedding map (coming from the encoder) for semantic reasoning. The model is works only with visual features and the Swin Transformer backbone is dedicated to extract those features. We also utilize the hybrid bipartite matching to invoke the domain shift property
in order to save the pretraining time and use the publicly available pre-trained weights (e.g. here we used the pretrained weights of MS-COCO dataset) from diverse domains for a similar task which improves model generalization. The code will be available at: https://github.com/ayanban011/SwinDocSegmenter
